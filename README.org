* dotfiles

A simple, minimalistic and very personal setup and configuration for
Ubuntu.

Just download and run a trivial shell scrip on a fresh Ubuntu install:
: wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stevenharford/dotfiles/master/bin/setup.sh
: source setup.sh

Then tidy up:
: rm setup.sh

That's it, happy coding!
