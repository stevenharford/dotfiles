* dotfiles

A simple, minimalistic and very personal set of Linux configuration
files.

Want to try them out? It's simple. Clone and enter this repository:
: git clone https://github.com/stevenharford/dotfiles.git ~/projects/dotfiles
: cd ~/projects/dotfiles

Then install the dotfiles. I use [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/][GNU Stow]] for this:
: stow -t ~ --no-folding emacs fish git gnupg tmux

Happy coding!
