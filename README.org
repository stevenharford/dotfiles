* dotfiles

A simple, minimalist and very personal setup and configuration for
[[https://ubuntu.com/][Ubuntu]].

Just download and run a trivial shell script on a fresh Ubuntu
install:
: wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stevenharford/dotfiles/master/setup.sh
: source setup.sh

Then tidy up:
: rm setup.sh

I generally use [[https://www.docker.com/][Docker]] containers, based on the [[https://hub.docker.com/_/ubuntu][official Ubuntu image]],
when developing and experimenting with software. This provides
enormous flexibility without screwing up my system. Building and
interacting with these containers is a breeze:
: docker build -t play -f ~/dotfiles/play.Dockerfile .
: docker run -d -it --rm --name chess --hostname chess -v "$PWD":"$PWD" -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix -e DISPLAY="$DISPLAY" play
: docker exec chess gnome-terminal
: docker stop chess

That's it, happy coding!
